Welcome to ZigZag!

ZigZag is a game built in C using an ARM7 processor to create a fully responsive game!
While coded in C, the game is built to run with an FPGA device and renders a screen to play on.

Features include:
- Game over!
- High Score
- Responsive controls
- Gems
- And more!

Please note: as this was part of University of Toronto's ECE243 course (Final project), code is currently not provided. Please contact me for more information!
